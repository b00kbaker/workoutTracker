  ## Description 
  
  *The what, why, and how:* 
   Using MongoDB and Express to create a workout app with several routes including HomePage, an Exercise Dashboard with several charts, and an input form describing a Cardio or Resistance workout.

  
  ## Instructions
   This project is deployed on Heroku which brings the user to the HomePage asking if they want to input a new workout or update the current day's submission. Either answer will bring the user to a simple form asking questions about the type of exercise, the length or  weight (if applicable), and how long the exercise lasted. A week's worth of this workout and exercise data can be viewed on the Dashboard or the user can view the last workout simply on the HomePage.
